Hyper text markup language is made up of three steps, first we have the opening tag content, secondly the content and then last the closing tag. HTML is made up of strings that have markups and content. In 1989 Tim Benres Lee first discovered this well kmown languange in (CERN) European Organization for Nuclear Research while working.

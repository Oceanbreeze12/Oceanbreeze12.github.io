	 Asking for help is one of the hardest things for me and I have recently learned it's ok to ask  questions. So if you ever get stucked it's ok to ask a question you're proably not the only perosn asking that question. You can also turn to the study groups. Also try taking a break and coming back to the question. Taking a break can clear your mind and give you a different perspective. Eveyone has a different way to study, some people need peace and quiet others prefer music, I personally love to study with music. When you get stuck find your niche.

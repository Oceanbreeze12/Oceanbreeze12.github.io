A few years ago I was thinking about going back to college.  Someone suggested  trying out  Computer Science. Looked at different schools, then realized it would  be impossible to maintian work and school at the same time. Late at night on my way home, blasting music trying to keep myself awake. A commercial came on about Flatiron school. So repeating the name to myself that way I could do my research about the school and what they have to offer. After scrutinizing the  programs, it seemed that web development  was the way to go.  Now it was time to make a decision,  that night I asked for a sign, if this program is for me Lord I need a scholarship. Next day I went online, googled my little fingers off trying to find reviews about the school's programs, the experiences of others and their outcomes.  The reviews revealed some not so good experiences but the  majority of the results were positive. For me the option to take the course full time online was a prodigious. This program allows  work and school. So I took a leap of faith and applied and got accepted. Now my journey begins to start the next chapter in my life an hopefully yeiled a sucessful job.

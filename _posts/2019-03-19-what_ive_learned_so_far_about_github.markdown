		 On February 8th, 2008 GitHub was founded even though it existed since 2007. Ruby on Rails was used to develop GitHub by Chris Wanstrath, P.J.  Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon. Now one of the main uses of GitHub is coding. There is a list of other uses, such as but not limited to:
			 *Commit history
			 *Emojis 
			 *Exposures in different packages security alerts of know common vulnerabilities
			  * Pull requests
       *README file (looks familiar ?  )
			 *Visualization of Geospatial data
			 Fun fact GitHub's mascot octocat was created by graphic designer Simon Oxley. Octocat has five octopus like arms, part octopus and part cat. Simon Oxley also designed the well known twitter bird. 
			 What is Git ? Glad you asked, Git is a content tracker that provides branches and merges, a branch is a pointer to the latest commit in the git repository. There are two different types of repository, Remote and local repository. A remote repository is stored in a server and your local repository is stored in the computer of each developer.
			 Moving on, How to use Git?, First step is to download git, then create your local git repository by  creating  a folder for your project, give it a really cool name or this first thing that comes to mind. Then we having the Staging area, which is  used to keep track of all files that are to be committed. "Git add." is used to stage a file inside your project folder. Committing is used to indicate what code changes have been previously done for this you use "git commit". That's all I've learned so far about Github, thank you, next!
